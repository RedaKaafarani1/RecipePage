## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I reinforced what I have been learning in HTML and CSS for a week now. I don't think this is a very optimal way of achieving the result but it gets the job done!

### Continued development

I still need to focus on different points:
- Understanding the different positioning in CSS
- writing optimal CSS code without doing hacky methods to achieve the result

### Useful resources

- [Youtube HTML and CSS project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np3L1lb-Uvs&list=PLImJ3umGjxdD3ov2lwg0SM5rxz5v9FjOf) - This helped me in shaping the HTML file as well as understanding many concepts of CSS and how it works in conjunction with HTML
